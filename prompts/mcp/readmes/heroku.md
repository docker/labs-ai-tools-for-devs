## Tools

### Tool: **`create_addon`**

Create a new Heroku add-on for an application. Use this tool when you need to: 1) Provision a new add-on for your app, 2) Specify a particular service and plan, 3) Set a custom name for the add-on or attachment. The tool handles the provisioning process and returns the new add-on's details.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `app` | `string` | Specifies the target Heroku app for add-on provisioning. Requirements and behaviors: 1) App must exist and be accessible to you with write permissions, 2) App region may affect which add-on services are available, 3) If app is in a Private Space, only add-ons compliant with the space requirements can be provisioned. The add-on will be provisioned directly to this app and config vars will be set automatically. |
| `serviceAndPlan` | `string` | Specifies which add-on service and plan to provision. Format and behavior: 1) Required format: "service_slug:plan_slug" (e.g., "heroku-postgresql:essential-0"), 2) If only service slug provided, the default (usually the cheapest or free) plan will be selected, 3) Some plans may have prerequisites (e.g., inside a private space, specific regions). Use list_addon_services and list_addon_plans tools to discover available options. |
| `as` | `string` *optional* | Sets a custom local name for the add-on attachment in the app. Important details: 1) Must be unique within the app (no other attachment can use the same name), 2) Used as a prefix for config vars (e.g., "CUSTOM_NAME_URL" instead of "HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_URL"), 3) Makes the add-on easier to identify in app context (e.g., "as: DATABASE" is clearer than "postgresql-curved-12345"), 4) When omitted, Heroku generates a default name based on the add-on service. Best practice: Use meaningful names that indicate the add-on's purpose (e.g., "PRIMARY_DB", "CACHE"). |
| `name` | `string` *optional* | Assigns a custom global identifier for the add-on instance. Key characteristics: 1) Must be unique across all add-ons in Heroku (not just your apps), 2) Can be used to reference the add-on from any app or context, 3) Useful for identifying the add-on in cross-app scenarios or automation, 4) When omitted, Heroku generates a unique name (e.g., "postgresql-curved-12345").
