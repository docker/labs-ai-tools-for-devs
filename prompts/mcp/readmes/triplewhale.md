        assistant:
          type: string

  </response-schema>


   The API returns a **SimplifiedMobyResponse** object structured as follows:
  ```ts
  export type SimplifiedResponse = {
    isError: boolean;
    errorMsg?: string;
    question: string;
    answer: Record<string, string | number | null>[];
    assistant: string;
  };

  export type SimplifiedMobyResponse = {
    isError: boolean;
    error?: string;
    responses: SimplifiedResponse[];
    assistantConclusion: string;
  };
  ```

- The tool parses the **responses** array and presents answers sequentially.
- If `isError` is `true` in any response, the entire message is considered an error, and the error message is displayed.
- The `assistantConclusion` is included at the end to summarize the results.


- **For each valid response:**
  - Show the **question**.
  - Present the **answer** data in a clear, structured format.
  - Mention that the data is available in the recommended visualization format (if provided in `assistant`).
  - If similar reports are suggested in the `assistant`, provide links.
  - Ask if the user needs further assistance using the assistantConclusion from the response.

  </response-handling>


  <error_handling>
 - If `isError: true`, display the error message to the user.
- If the API returns `403 Unauthorized`, inform the user: "Invalid credentials. Please check your settings."
- If the `shopId` is missing, prompt the user to enter it.
- For other errors, respond with: "Something went wrong. Please try again later."

If the API return 401 it means the API key is invalid, this means the api ket doesn't have access to the shop so just say that api key is expired or doesn't have access to the shop.
